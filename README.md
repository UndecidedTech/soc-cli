# soc-cli
TUI application to quickly launch streams for ongoing soccer games

I talked to the guys behind Ani-cli and this isn't really worth maintaining because the streams are 1000x worse and more inconsistent than what the anime sites offer, and the URL's for the sports streaming sites change so often. But this was still a cool proof of concept to do some webscraping in a useful way in a language I had never used before.
